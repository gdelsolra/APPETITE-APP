# APPETITE-APP


# App Goals and Purpose:
My app, Appetite Lab, was built to help people understand their fast-food cravings and turn them into delicious, homemade meals. By managing pantry items, tracking expiration dates, and even storing fresh produce, the app's goal is to save users money and reduce food waste. The future vision includes using AI to suggest personalized meal plans that feel just as satisfying as fast food but are made at home.


# User-Friendly Screens and Features:
The app’s key screens include a home screen with quizzes to find out food preferences, an inventory screen to manage pantry items, and a meal planner to recommend recipes. I focused on making everything easy to navigate, with a clean layout, minimal clicks, and accessible features. The design was all about making inventory and meal planning feel straightforward, so users wouldn’t be overwhelmed by options.


# How I Approached Coding:
I started by building out the XML files for the interface and then moved on to the logic with Java, using SQLite for data storage. This helped me keep everything modular and organized. Moving forward, I’d use this same strategy to keep code clean and easy to manage, especially when working with databases like SQLite for storing user data.


# Testing Process:
Testing was all about catching issues early. I’d implement a feature, then test it right away to make sure it worked, especially for those “what if” scenarios. This helped me find and fix bugs as I went, which saved me from facing a pile of errors at the end. It also taught me the importance of testing each piece as soon as it’s built.


# Challenges and Innovation:
One of my biggest challenges was figuring out how to structure the code in a way that didn’t pile up errors. I ended up restarting a few times to make everything cleaner and more organized. This experience taught me how to plan out the structure in a way that I could easily improve on without having to backtrack too much.


# Proud Moment:
I’m especially proud of the pantry management feature! It felt great to see it work smoothly, allowing users to add, edit, and delete items with SQLite handling the data. This part brought together everything I’ve learned about building a user-friendly interface and managing data behind the scenes.
